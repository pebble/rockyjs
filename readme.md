# Rocky.js
> Pebble's first step towards exploring the possibility of including a JavaScript runtime in Pebble's operating system.

*Rocky.js* is a version of Pebble's firmware that has been [transpiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) to JavaScript, and that can be attached to an HTML canvas. Above you see an example of that (and [even more examples here](examples/)).

### That's a weird first step!

You're right! Typically when people want to include a JavaScript runtime on some hardware they begin by evaluating various JavaScript runtimes (or writing their own), and getting one of those running on their hardware.

We're doing this in parallel - but by first creating (and publishing) a transpiled version of our firmware that can be run in the browser, we're enabling ourselves, and the wonderful JavaScript community, to rapidly experiment with what things could look like when JavaScript is a first-class language on our platform.

We're interested in seeing how you approach JavaScript watchface development, as well as how you interact with (and wrap) our existing [C-style API](http://developer.pebble.com/docs/c/) to make it look and feel more like JavaScript.

### What about Pebble.js?

If you're familiar with Pebble and JavaScript, there's a good chance you may also be familiar with [*Pebble.js*](https://developer.pebble.com/docs/pebblejs/).

*Pebble.js* allows you to write your *application logic* in JavaScript (which is executed on the phone with [PebbleKit JS](https://developer.pebble.com/docs/js/)). *Pebble.js* also includes a significant amount of C and JavaScript code that interacts with your application logic and passes messages between the phone (where the application logic takes place), and the watchapp (where the UI is displayed, and events occur).

The goal of *Rocky.js* is to include a JS runtime in Pebble's firmware, which would allow us to run JavaScript applications *directly on the watch*.

## Contributing

We're interested in seeing what kinds of tools developers create when they have access to a browser-based and pixel-perfect Pebble, as well as how developers wrap our C-style APIs to make them more JavaScript friendly!

If you create something interesting with *Rocky.js*, add it to the [examples](//github.com/pebble/rockyjs/tree/master/examples) folder, submit a pull-request, and we'll take a look. This is a great opportunity to *directly* influence how Pebble approaches JavaScript documentation and API design.

You can see what community members have built with *Rocky.js* on the [Community Examples](http://pebble.github.io/rockyjs/examples/community.html) page.

## Development

### Dependencies

*Rocky.js* uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) as a build system and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) for dependency management. If you are unfamiliar with these technologies, we recommend you read their respective guides.

### Getting Started

To begin working with the *Rocky.js* repository, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:pebble/rockyjs.git
$ cd rockyjs
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

The default build task (invoking `grunt` without arguments) will combine all JavaScript, render markdown, and replace file references.

### Rocky.js API / Functionality

One of the main goals of *Rocky.js* is to better understand how JavaScript developers approach the Pebble API, and Pebble development in general.

The initial version of *Rocky.js* uses Pebble's existing C-style API and JavaScript syntax, though at the moment *not all* APIs are implemented.

See [Rocky Documentation](docs/) for more details.

### Working with the Examples

The [examples](examples/) are designed to be run directly from the file system without needing to build them, and demonstrate some of the things that can be accomplished with the current implementation.

More information about each example can be found on the example's webpage.

## Transpiling the Pebble Firmware

**NOTE:** If you are *not* a Pebble employee, you should ignore this section of the README. If you would like to be a Pebble employee, take a look at [Pebble's jobs page](https://pebble.com/jobs).

If you have access to the [Pebble firmware repository](https://github.com/pebble/tintin), you can
- build *applib* with `-target emscripten`.
  - The default Grunt task of this repository will replace the file `src/transpiled.js` with
`${tintin_root}/build/applib/applib-targets/emscripten/applib.js` if it exists.
- run `grunt newer:uglify:applib --verbose` to debug the above step if necessary

Be aware that the minification task might take a while.
