        <h2>What's going on?</h2>
        <p>
            Similar to the <a href="../simple">simple example</a> it binds Rocky.js to a canvas, and update the output at a regular interval.
        </p>
        <p>
            This example uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APNG">animated PNGs</a>
            to construct a <a href="https://developer.pebble.com/guides/pebble-apps/resources/animated-pngs/">GBitmapSequence</a>.
            APNGs are supported by Pebble natively. You need to
            <a href="https://developer.pebble.com/guides/pebble-apps/resources/animated-pngs/#creating-apngs-from-gifs">convert GIFs to APNGs</a> before using them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, if your image is accessible via a URL, you can simply call
            <code>rocky.gbitmap_sequence_create(url)</code>.
            Have a look at the code of this example.
        </p>

        <p>
            The JS version of this API differs slightly from the
            <a href="https://developer.pebble.com/docs/c/Graphics/Graphics_Types/#gbitmap_sequence_update_bitmap_next_frame">C-Version</a>.
            In particular, use <code>graphics_draw_bitmap_sequence(ctx, sequence, point)</code> to draw an image sequence.
